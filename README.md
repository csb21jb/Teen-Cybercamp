# Cyber Bootcamp Deployment Guide

Welcome to the **Cyber Bootcamp** deployment guide! This project provides a robust environment for teaching cybersecurity concepts and running Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges in a virtualized environment. Below is a step-by-step guide to set up your Cyber Bootcamp server, including all necessary prerequisites and configurations.


## **Prerequisites**

### **1. Choose Your Cloud Platform**
Select a cloud provider of your choice. Some common options include:
- **DigitalOcean**
- **Microsoft Azure**
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**
- **Google Cloud Platform**

### **2. Provision a Debian Instance**
- Choose **Debian** as your operating system.
- Recommended resources for production:
  - **50 GB Storage**
  - **4 vCPU**
  - **16 GB RAM**
- Testing Purposes:
  - **2 GB RAM** (suitable for small-scale testing, but performance will degrade with 50+ users on same machine).

### **3. Set Machine Name**
- Name your machine **`Cyber Bootcamp`** during the setup process.

### **4. Open Required Ports**
To enable communication and access for CTF challenges and lesson environments, open the following ports in your cloud provider's firewall:
- **8080**: Used for web-based services.
- **8180**: Reserved for application access.
- **3000**: Reserved for lesson machines or dashboards.
- **8091**: For monitoring or additional tools.
- **4000-4999**: Wide range for peer-to-peer activities (e.g., `netcat` exercises).


## **Installation Steps**

### **1. Update and Install Basic Tools**
Log in as the root user on your new Debian machine and run the following command:
```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt install wget -y
```

### **2. Run the Cyber Bootcamp Installation Script**
Use `wget` to download and execute the installation script:
```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csb21jb/Teen-Cybercamp/refs/heads/main/master_install.sh | bash
```

### **3. OpenSSH Server Configuration During Installation**
- During the script execution, you may encounter a prompt for the **OpenSSH Server** configuration.
- When asked **"What do you want to do with the existing configuration?"**, select:
  - **Keep the local version installed** by ensuring it is highlighted and pressing `Tab` to select **OK**.
- This allows the script to make additional updates to the SSH configuration later.


## **Post-Installation**

### **1. Check Docker Containers**
If there are any issues with the Docker containers, you can manually manage them using the following commands:
1. Navigate to the root home directory:
   ```bash
   cd /root
   ```
2. Run the following commands to restart Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker compose down && docker compose up -d
   ```

### **2. Verify Services**
Ensure all services and containers are running:
```bash
docker ps
```


## **Customization**

### **1. Script Customization**
The installation script is designed to be flexible:
- Modify the script to deploy additional Docker containers or services.
- Adjust configurations for your specific classroom or CTF needs.

### **2. Scaling**
- For classrooms with more than 50 students, ensure at least **16 GB RAM** to prevent performance degradation.
- If running on lower specs (e.g., 2 GB RAM), performance will be limited to small-scale testing.


## **Support**
If you encounter issues or need further assistance, check the following:
- Docker container logs:
  ```bash
  docker logs <container_id>
  ```
- The `docker-compose.yaml` file located in the `/root` directory for configuration errors.

Feel free to contribute to the project or reach out to the community for additional support.


## **Future Enhancements**
The current setup is designed for flexibility and scalability. Future updates will include:
- Enhanced SSH configuration for secure and efficient management.
- Additional lesson modules and CTF challenges preconfigured in the environment.
